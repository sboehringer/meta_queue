== Description ==

Does your sysadmin suck by not being able to provide a scalable Open Grid Scheduler installation? Then this project is for you. Jobs are scheduled locally and are fed to a job scheduler always staying under a pre-specified limit for the job count. At the moment only an Open Grid Scheduler/Sun Grid Engine backend is provided. Implementing a backend for another batch queuing system should be straightforward.
